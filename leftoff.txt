I just cannot get mariadb to get running. When I execute all the steps I have in my 
Dockerfile inside the container everything works just fine but as soon as I let the
docker-compose do its work it does not work for some reason.

It either complains about the socket file it cannot find or mysql gets furious with my syntax
altough it's all fine when I do the exact same inside the container.

Either my configuration just is not right or I don't get my Dockerfile right. I really dont know
what to do.
Having mysql running before the CMD for configuring the inside of the database really gets on my
nerves, I have to find work arounds that are just messy and utter bulshit. Is there really no
other solution?

Getting a 404 File not found (index.php)
Trying to set up wordpress with php-fpm atm
No clue what it could be. Paths seem all to be fine. index.php seems fine.

Although I have some doubt about index.php,
maybe creating my own index.php or index.html could tell me more

Also the inception.conf for nginx might be off
according to this https://serverfault.com/questions/904716/404-not-found-with-nginx-and-php
	# this path MUST be exactly as docker-compose.fpm.volumes,
    	# even if it doesn't exists in this dock.
    	root /var/wwww/html;
maybe that's why it cannot find the wordpress files

Maybe the nginx-error.log file inside the nginx container may give some insight
